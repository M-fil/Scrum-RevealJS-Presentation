Hello, my name is Maxim, and today we will talk with you about Scrum. 
## What is Scrum?
If you are somehow connected with programming you’ve probably heard this word. 
Let’s start with the definition of Scrum. There are a lot of books and articles which can tell us about it. In such media people often call Scrum as a method, an approach or methodology. Even in the book, which you can see on the slide, I found that the author writes “Scrum is a revolutionary approach to project management”. What can we understand from this sentence? First of all, Scrum is an approach. Secondly, it is a revolutionary approach. Thirdly, Scrum is about project management. Finally, it is all a lie. Yes, you haven’t overheard. It is a lie. I’ll tell you more: each word in this sentence is a lie. Scrum isn’t an approach, it isn’t revolutionary and it isn’t about project management.

The first question you probably have: “If Scrum is not an approach, a method, or even methodology, so what is it?” Scrum is a framework. What? Framework? I understand that the word framework developers usually associate with Angular or View. Scrum also fits in this group. 

But let’s return to the Scrum definition. There is Scrum Guide, which is the most true guide about Scrum because it was written by its creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland. In this Guide, it is said that Scrum is a FRAMEWORK for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. To fully understand the meaning let’s discuss the definition of the word “framework”. A framework is a set of basic elements and rules on which the development process is built. It means that Scrum as a framework provides a foundation on which developers build programs.

Okay, now we know what Scrum is and who tells the truth and who lies. But why do we need to use Scrum? It should be mentioned that according to the statistics Scrum is used by 90% of the companies. Why is it so popular? Maybe it is because Scrum is founded on empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions. There are 3 crucial elements of Scrum and every empirical process. They are transparency, inspection, and adaptation. 

Transparency tells that the main characteristics of the process must be visible for the Scrum team. For example, transparency requires that all participants of Scrum should know what the result of the project will be.

The second crucial aspect of Scrum is Inspection. This word speaks for itself. Scrum users should inspect what goes well and what goes wrong.

The last aspect of Scrum is Adaptation and it appears after Inspection. It means that the Scrum team firstly needs to inspect its progress and then if something goes wrong it should make changes and solve problems.
Let’s summarize this part. Scrum relies on Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation. But who are the heroes, who are this super team that adheres to these 3 principles? Let’s introduce them.
## Scrum Team
The first character of this amazing framework is a Product Owner. You may think that he is a person who owns a product that is a customer. It makes sense. But it isn’t exactly so. The Product Owner is the single person in the Scrum team who can manage the Product tasks or Product Backlog. No one else on the team can change tasks on their own.

The next hero of the Scrum team is represented by people who design a product. People who want to become, from my point of view, 99% of Rolling Scopes students. It is a Development Team, programmers who design the project. The optimal size of the Development Team varies from 3 to 9 people. It has been proven that with this number of members maximum efficiency is achieved. 
The last person in the Scrum team, the person who knows Scrum as the back of his hand, the guru of this framework, is a Scrum Master. His work is to promote and support Scrum as it is written in the Scrum Guide. He tries to help everyone to change interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team. 

Let’s calculate the parts of a Scrum Team together. There is a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Yeah, there are 3 crucial parts. Not big enough, isn’t it? But this little number of members in the Scrum Team allows participants to communicate more and discuss problems in more detail. According to the Scrum Guide, there are 4 events that were created to inspect progress and make changes in the shortest possible time.
## Scrum Events
All events are held during the Sprint. Sprint is one more crucial term in the Scrum. It is often called the heart of Scrum. It usually ranges from 1 to 4 weeks and in this period the Scrum Team creates the most useable and potentially releasable product Increment. It also should be mentioned that there are no holidays or any weekends after the end of the Sprint. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous one.

Okay, we’ve understood the meaning of the Sprint but what do we need to do before starting it? What should we do before starting any important task? Usually, we promise ourselves that we will do it tomorrow. But as the perfect variant, we should plan our work. The Sprint also starts with the planning. In the world of Scrum, it is called Sprint Planning.
During this event, the team discusses the crucial question: «What can we do in this Sprint to release the product?» During the Sprint Planning, the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal and selects items for the Sprint from the Product Backlog.

Okay, we planned the Sprint. It is cool. But I’ve also said that Scrum allows the team to communicate more. There is a special event for this purpose called Daily Scrum. But communicate more it is was an exaggeration. Actually, Daily Scrum is strictly held for no more than 15 minutes. Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within this time-box.

At this event, each member of the Development Team tells everyone what he did yesterday and what he is going to do today. Thus, Daily Scrum is just a plan for the upcoming day.

The next Scrum event is a Sprint Review. It relies on the Scrum concepts of Inspection and Adaptation. This event usually takes less than 4 hours and is held at the end of the Sprint. The main purpose of it is to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.

The last event which was created to fix Scrum Team fuckups is a Sprint Retrospective. It is always held after the Sprint Review and it is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements. It takes always less than 3 hours. By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should identify improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint.

Let’s view all the events process held during the Sprint. We always start with Sprint Planning where we select tasks from the product backlog for the Sprint. Then we have Daily Scrum which is conducted every day and takes no more than 15 minutes. At the end of the Sprint, we inspect and adapt our work process. Sprint Review helps us in it. Finally, we have  Sprint Retrospective where the team identifies improvements which it can apply in the next Sprint. This loop repeats every Sprint.

Now it is time to make some conclusions. Scrum is the most applicable and productive framework in the programming sphere. It proved its efficiency in real life and therefore it is so popular. Not all information was covered but if you want to learn more about Scrum I highly recommend opening the description. There is a link on Scrum Guide that is the most truthful source of information about Scrum.

Thank you very much for watching. See you soon. Goodbye!
